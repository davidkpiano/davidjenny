## Gifts

We are thrilled to celebrate our wedding with you and deeply appreciate your love and presence.

If you wish to contribute, we have several registries available. However, we would be especially grateful for donations to our travel fund or our environmental fund. We are excited to continue our adventures together, with plans to celebrate our honeymoon on an African safari in 2025.

Thank you for being a part of our special day ❤️
